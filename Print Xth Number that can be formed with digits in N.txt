Print Xth Number that can be formed with digits in N
The program must accept two integers N and X as input. The program must print the Xth number from 1 which can be formed using the digits in N. 
If there is no Xth number then the program must print - 1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N, X <= 999999999

Input Format: 
The first line contains the value of N. 
The second line contains the value of X.

Output Format: 
The first line contains the Xth number or -1.


Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 231
Output: 32

Explanation: 
The N = 123 forms the sequential order of numbers are 
1 2 3 12 13 21 23 31 32 123 132 213 231 312 321. 
Then, the 9th number in the sequence is 32. So, 32 is printed as the output.


Python Program:

from itertools import permutations
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
l=[] 
while(a>0):
	c=a%10 
	a//=10
	l.append(c) 
l1=[] 
for i in range(1, len(1)+1): 
	for j in permutations (l,i):
	ti="" 
	for t in j:
		t1+=str(t) 
	if int(t1)!=0:
		l1.append(int(t1)) 
l1=set(l1) 
res=[i for i in l1] 
res.sort() 

if b<len(res):
	print(res[b-1]) 
else:
	print(-1)

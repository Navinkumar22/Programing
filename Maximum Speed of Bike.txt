Maximum Speed of Bike

An integer N and N integers are passed as input. A bike racing track is numbered with the
given N integers in the order of their occurrence. Also two integers P and Q are passed as
input. Whenever a racer crosses the number P, the speed of the bike is increased by P units per
hour. Whenever a racer crosses the number Q, the speed of the bike is decreased by Q units
per hour. Print the maximum speed achieved during the race. The initial speed of the bike is 40
units per hour.

Boundary Condition(s):
1<=N <= 50
1<=P,Q <= 300

Input Format:
The first line contains N, P and Q separated by space(s).
The second line contains N integers separated by space(s).

Output Format:
The first line contains the maximum speed of the bike.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4 20 10
2 20 20 10
Output:
80

Program:

N,P,Q=map(int,input().split())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
S=40
a=[40]
for i in range(N):
	if l[i]==P:
		S+=P 
	elif 1[i]==Q:
		S-=Q
	o.append(s) 
print(max(a))

Tower Line of Sight

IssueFour towers A, B, C, D are to be erected.
Tower A is to communicate with tower C.
Tower B is to communicate with tower D.
Line of sight issue can occur under the following conditions-
when tower B or D is in the straight line connecting A and C-
when tower A or C is in the straight line connecting B and D
The program must accept the co-ordinates of all four towers and print yes or no depending on whether Line of sight issue will occur or not.

Input Format:
The first line will contain X and Y co-ordinates of tower A separated by a space.
The second line will contain X and Y co-ordinates of tower B separated by a space.
The third line will contain X and Y co-ordinates of tower C separated by a space.
The fourth line will contain X and Y co-ordinates of tower D separated by a space

Output Format:
The first line will contain yes or no (smaller case)

Boundary Conditions:
The value of the co-ordinates will be from -500 to 500.

Example Input/Output 1:

Input:
0 0
0 -2
2 0
0 2

Output:
yes

Example Input/Output 2:

Input:
0 0
0 -2
2 0
0 -5

Output:
no

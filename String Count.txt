The program must accept a string S and a character matrix of size RxC as input. 
The program must print the count of occurrence(s) of S in the given matrix (row-wise). 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= R, C <= 50 
1 <= Length of the string S <= 99 

Input Format: 
The first line contains the string value S. 
The second line contains the value of R and C separated by space(s). 
The next R lines contain C characters each separated by space(s). 

Output Format: 
The first line contains the count of occurrences of S in the given matrix.

Unique Embedded Decimal values
The program must accept an integer N as the input. 
The program must print the numbers that can be formed from 
the binary representation of N while traversing sequentially from start to end.

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= N <= 999999999  

Input Format: 
The first line contains the value of N.

Output Format: 
The first line contains the numbers that can be formed from the binary representation of N.

Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: 12
Output: 13 6 12 2 4 0
 
Explanation: 
The binary representation of 
12 - 1100 can form the following order of binary representations 
1 11 110 1100 10 100 0 in sequence. 
So, their corresponding decimal values 1 3 6 12 2 4 0 are printed as output.

Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 7
Output: 1 3 7 

Program:

a=int(input())
b=bin(a)[2:] 
c=[] 
for i in range(len(b)): 
	for j in range(i, len(b)):
		t=int(b[i:j+1],2) 
		if t not in c:
			c.append(t) 
print(*c)

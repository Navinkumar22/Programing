Rearrange Matrix without Duplicates in Each Row 
The program must accept an integer matrix of size RxC as input. 
The program must print YES if the given matrix can be rearranged in such a way that each row must not contain any duplicate values. 
Else the program must print NO as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 
1 <= R, C <= 50 
0 <= Matrix Elements <= 999999 

Input Format: 
The first line contains the value of R and C separated by space(s). 
The next R lines contain C integers separated by space(s). 

Output Format: The first line contains either YES or NO. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input: 
3 3 
4 4 5 
5 6 7 
7 5 7 

Output: 
YES 

Explanation: One of the possible rearrangements, 
4 5 7 
4 5 7 
6 5 7 
There is no repeated integer in each row. 


Example Input/Output 2: 

Input: 
4 3 
4 4 4
5 5 7 
7 7 5 
4 7 7 

Output: 
NO 

Explanation: 
One of the possible rearrangements, 

4 5 7 
4 5 7 
4 5 7 
4 7 7 

In the rearranged matrix, 7 is repeated within the last row.

Program:

x,y=map(int,input().split())
a=[] 
for i in range(x):
	t=list(map(int,input().split()))) 
	for j in t:
		a.append(j) 
List=list(set(a)) 
for i in List: 
	if a.count(i) >x:
		print("NO")
		quit() 
print("YES")
